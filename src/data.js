        question: "What is a novel coronavirus",
        answer:
          "A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.,",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?",
        answer: `On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.`,

        question: "How does the virus spread?",
        answer: `The virus that causes COVID-19 most commonly spreads between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet, or 2 arm lengths).
        It spreads through respiratory droplets or small particles, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes.`,

        question: "Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19",

        It spreads through respiratory droplets or small particles, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes.`,
      },
      {
        question: "What is community spread",
        answer: `Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website.​`,

      },
      {
        question: "Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?",
        answer: `There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.`,

        question:
          "What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?",
        answer: `People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
    
        Fever or chills,
        Cough,
        Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
        Fatigue,
        Muscle or body aches,
        Headache,
        New loss of taste or smell,

        Nausea or vomiting,
        Diarrhea`,
      },
      {
        question: "When should I seek emergency care if I have COVID-19?",
        answer: `Look for emergency warning signs for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately: 
        Trouble breathing,
        Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,
        New confusion,
        Inability to wake or stay awake,

    accordion: [
      {
        question: "Should I be tested for a current infection?",
        answer: `Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.

        If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.
        
        CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments and healthcare providers.
        
        You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing.`,
      },
      {
        question:
          "Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?",
        answer: `Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others.`,
